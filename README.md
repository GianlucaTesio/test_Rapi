## Concepts
### Single responsibility principle
This principle establishes that each class must have a unique responsibility within our software, and this responsibility must be defined and concrete.
A class must do only one thing. It is difficult to determine what is only one thing, but when you ask yourself what this class does and you get multiple answers, you should doubt if you are complying with this principle.</p>
“A class should have only one reason to change” – Uncle Bob</p>
Some items that show that this principle is not being fulfilled would be:

- A class is too long, too many lines of code.
- Every time a modification or new functionality needs to be introduced, it is necessary to modify in many places.
- There are too many relationships between classes.
- It mixes functionalities from different layers of the architecture.

</p>

The purpose of this concept is:

- Avoid coupling and strong dependencies
- Promote scalability
- Promote code readability
- Code change speed

### Clean code
Code is considered clean when it is easy to read and understand. </p>
Characteristics that a clean code should have: 

- Variable and function names have to be descriptive.
- The code must be well structured and with the correct tabulation. 
- Just comment what is necessary.
- Must have a high test coverage percentage. 

## Future improvements
* Improve the design of the application
* Add more unit tests
